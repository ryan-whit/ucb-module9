GitHub repo: https://github.com/ryan-whit/ucb-module9

## Description

Use `node.js` and `inquirer` to generate a README.md file using command line prompts.

- As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.
- When I am prompted for input to the README template, then I can provide that input from the command line.
- When I am finished providing my input, then the app auto-generates a populated README file using the template.
